Network File System allows you mount and access files on a remote system as if they were on your local machine. RPC binds to 111 and you can use that port to enumerate other services using rpc (rpc-info script)

You can then use the nmap scripts to gather as much info on the nfs side as possible.
`nmap -p 111 --script nfs* $IP`

Then you can mount the shared drive to your own machine and dig into it.
`sudo mount -o nolock $IP:/$shareDirectory $localMount`

If you cannot access the file: 
1. you may need to check what UUID is allowed to view the file:
- `ls -l`
2. And then create a new user on your local machine:
- `adduser`
3. Change the UUID of the newly created user:
- `sudo sed -i -e 's/[CURRENTUUID]/[NEWUUID]/g' /etc/passwd`
4. Check and make sure the command ran properly:
- `cat /etc/passwd|grep $user`
5. `su` to the new user and read away.

Useful nmap scripts:
rpc-info.se
nfs-ls.se
nfs-showmount.se
nfs-statfs.se
